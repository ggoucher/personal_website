                    <h2>About Me: Self-taught, Building for good, Building for all.</h2>
                    <p>
                        After studying Economics at Bowdoin College for three years,
                        I decided to apply my critical thinking skills to trying something
                        new - web development. I bring interdisplinary skills to the table,
                        I've been a project manager collaborating with teams out of Tokyo, have
                        chaired a 30 person social house at my college, and have served as a leader 
                        rebuilding my schools sexual assault survivor support structure from the 
                        ground up. I have studied the social sciences, humanities, and STEM, and get a thrill 
                        out of it all. Being a Full Stack Developer gives me the oppurtunity to apply
                        my leadership skills, academic talent, and technical prowess to be an  
                        agile thinker, quick learner, and highly creative problem solver. 
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        I want to focus on projects that advocate for the common good, do the kind
                        of work and advocacy so needed right now. 
                    </p>

                        for a common good industry.
